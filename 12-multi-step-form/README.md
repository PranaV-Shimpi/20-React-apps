# Multi-step-form in React using Contexts


This is a multi-step form application built with React. Users can navigate through multiple form steps, providing information at each step, such as account details, personal information, final details, and payment information. The application provides a seamless experience for users to input data across different form sections and proceed to the next step.

## Concepts Used

- **React Components:** The application is built using React components to manage the UI and functionality.
- **Context API:** Context API is used to manage the application state, including user data such as selected items.
- **State Management:** React's `useState` hook is used to manage local component state, while the Context API is used for global state management across components.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Different components and UI elements are conditionally rendered based on the application state.
- **Array Manipulation:** JavaScript array methods like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter` are used to manipulate and display arrays of data, such as items in the shopping cart.
- **Input Handling:** Event handling is used to capture user input, such as checkbox selection for adding items to the cart.
- **CSS Styling:** Custom CSS styles are applied to the components to create a visually appealing user interface.
