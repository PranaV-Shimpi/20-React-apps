## Key Concepts Used:
Project demonstrates the usage of various React concepts:


- Package Name: **lodash.shuffle**
Description: A utility function in lodash for shuffling array elements randomly.
Usage: Easily shuffle array elements to create randomized lists or implement game mechanics.

- The **spread operator** (...): Spread operator allows for the expansion of arrays into individual elements, cloning or merging objects, and capturing multiple function arguments into an array.

- **`useEffect`**: This hook is used for handling side effects in functional components. In this project, `useEffect` is employed to fetch data from the Unsplash API when the component mounts.

- **`useState`**: Another hook used in functional components to manage state. In this project, `useState` is utilized to store the search query entered by the user and the resulting images retrieved from the API.

- **API handling**: The project demonstrates how to interact with an external API (Unsplash) to retrieve data. It involves making HTTP requests to the API endpoint and handling the response data.
 
- **Fetching API**: Using JavaScript's `fetch` function, this project retrieves images from the Unsplash API based on the user's search query.

- **CSS media queries**: Media queries in CSS allow the styling of a web page to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. This project utilizes CSS media queries to ensure the application's responsiveness across various devices.
